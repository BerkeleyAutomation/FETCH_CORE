""" Test absolute movement for the Fetch's base. 

I tested this by sending the Fetch to 12 locations spread out on the unit circle
from the origin from 

    roslaunch fetch_gazebo simulation.launch

and all of them are able to (first) go to that point, _then_ call
`robot.position_start_pose()` and successfully come back to the starting
position (the origin) along with the angle (which was set at zero). This is
within noise due to the inaccuracy of the robot, i.e. the final angle is often
in the range of (-5,5) instead of exactly 0.

Can insert this in the end of `robot.position_start_pose()` for debugging help

  print("second angle:   {:.3f}  ({:.1f})".format(final_angle,    final_angle*scale))

With the physical robot, the origin seems to be at the charging station so be
careful about sending the robot back there (it's crowded).
